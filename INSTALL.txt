This project has been made in Qt. Qt is a cross platform application framework
which practically runs in most devices.

To install the project, one of the following two ways can be used:

1. Using Qt SDK
---------------

After installing the Qt SDK, you'll have the Qt IDE also known as QtCreator.
Open the sith.pro file in QtCreator and then proceed to the "Run" button. The
project may ask for the build details, and directory where the software is to
be built. This though being a more heavyweight installation, is far easier to
use. The Qt SDK can be downloaded from:
http://qt-project.org/downloads

2. Using QMake
--------------

Qt has it's own version of CMake, where it requires the .pro file instead of
the standard MakeFile

To generate the makefile for the application if not present, would be:
On the command line, in your project's directory, type the following:

   qmake -o Makefile <project-name>.pro

This would create the Makefile after which is the stand CMake and Make
installation. I personally would still recommend Way 1. Further information
about QMake can be found in:
